TOPIC: Apple becomes the first trillion company in history.

Anynomous:
>> Apple with their good product environment becomes the first trillion company is 100% worth. I love iPhone.

Anonymous:
>> Agree (like).

Apple Blind Lover (IBL):
>> Yeah, Apple is da best (firework). iPhone is da best smartphone. Other phones are suck (dislike). Everythings is soooo smooth on iPhone.

Anonymous:
>> Yup !!! Apple always have the newest technology on their phone. It's excited when they present new iPhone every years.

Anonymous:
>> I'm Apple fan and it's kind of convenient if you have a whole Apple product environment but to be honest iPhone quiet dumb when you need to connect with other devices not in that environment. 

Samsung Blind Lover (SBL):
>> Huh ? What did you say ? Not iPhone, Galaxy must be the best phone. iPhone is "soooooooo" smooth that it need to reduce the performance without user's notice when battery not in good health (LOL).

IBL:
>> Yah reducing performance might be bad but much better than carrying a bomb in your pocket. Oops, sorry !! I meant Note 7 (haha). Besides, iOS updated that and  it not only safer phone but also more secured data than Android.

SBL:
>> Too secured to send a simple file through Bluetooth (haha). Only a fool will use  phone like that (giggle).

Someone:
>> Hey hey, why are you arguing ? Each phone has its own advantages, each brand has its own business direction. And each of you has your own reason to use phone right ? SBL likes Galaxy and ABL likes Apple, right ? 

IBL:
>> Yeah, you say right, I should not have over reacted like that.

SBL:
>> It's hard to say but you're right. It's not worth.

Someone:
>> That's better (like). BUT actually both of you two are stupid. Both Apple and Samsung are suck (haha).

Someone change his name to "Huawei Blind Lover".

Conversation still continue (true story icon)

===> Everyone has their own point of view, that will be better if you choose "agree to disagree" and have a calm conversation, not too critics about other ideas. If that you will have an effective communication.
